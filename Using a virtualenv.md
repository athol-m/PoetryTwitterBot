# Why use a ```virtualenv```?
For this project, I created and used a ```virtualenv``` to run my programs. 

This is because my laptop is running Python 2.7 but I needed Python 3.6. 
Rather than interfering with my computer's Python file structure, 
I created a virtual environment in which I installed Python 3.6 as well as other packages and libraries
including ```textgennrnn```, ```tensorflow```, ```pillow```, and ```tweepy```. 
By creating a ```virtualenv```, I also have the benefit of installing packages to the environment rather than including
the install in my scripts. This makes running scripts a little smoother (in my opinion). 

# How I set up my ```virtualenv```

### A little bit about my system first:
I'm using a 2014 Macbook Air running MacOS 10.13.1 (High Sierra). (And yes, I know I need to update my OS)
